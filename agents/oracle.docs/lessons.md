## [2026-05-06] Transition to Artifact-Based Verification

> **Tags:** #Process #Oracle #Neo

### Context
Agents were previously instructed to consult the Oracle persona via chat for historical context and decisions. This often resulted in chat messages that were never picked up or processed by the intended persona.

### The Issue
Chat-based consultation is asynchronous and unreliable for immediate blocking needs. Agents would wait for a response that might not come, stalling progress.

### The Solution
Replaced "Oracle First" chat-based consultation with "Artifacts First" document-based verification. Agents now read consolidated logs and sprint plans directly.

### The Rule (The "Lesson")
DO NOT consult the Oracle via chat (`@Oracle *ora ask ...`) for routine historical or context checks. Instead, read the following artifacts in order: 1) Mouse's sprint plan (`agents/mouse.docs/`), 2) Oracle's `lessons.md` and `memory.md`, and 3) the recent `CHAT.md` history.
